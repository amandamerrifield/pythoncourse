Python
- simpler* to learn than some other languages
- open source modules and packages (true of Java as well)
- the standard implementation is interpreted 
- object-oriented; So much so that everything is an object (really everything). Most devs code in a procedural way. 
- Doesn't require you to code in any particular way. Can do OO or Procedural or functional and it will not complain which can be difficult
- No guidance on what to choose
- Dynamically typed (you don't have to specify the type of the variable)
- case-sensitive
- some white space is mandatory 
- named after Monty Python 

Compiled or interpreted ?
- It's neither
- Standard implementation is interpreted but others are not 
- The language itself doesn't dictate whether it's compiled or interpreted
- Interpretation means that source code is compiled and executed at run time
- No separate compilation phase at run time
- source code -> bytecode -> machine code 
- Why bytecode ? To create platform independence ("write once run anywhere")
- Interpreter is system dependent 
- the python command starts the Python Virtual Machine (VM) which includes the interpreter to go from bytecode to machine code
- some implementations compile directly to machine code etc


Versions
- current 3.12
- the language was effectively rewritten between v2 and v3
- v2 is still supported even though it was supposed to be killed by now
- VScode will tel lyou at the bottom of the screen what version you're working with  
- Good to pay attention to versions because the version on the machine/ in the code I'm working on should match 
- Can have many versions installed at once

Two Modes of Execution in Python
- run the command with no arguments (inputs) which will take us into REPL mode; 
    ie execute one statement at a time
- run the command with a file name argument and then you're running Python in script mode
    ie execute all statements in a file
